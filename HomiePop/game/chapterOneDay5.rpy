    mc "LL is a team oriented strategy based game where 5 players fight each other, working their way to the other team's crystal."
    mc "The objective is to break the opponent's crystal before the other team gets to yours."
    mc "There are 3 lanes and a jungle, which contains neutral monsters that can be slain for resources or team buffs"
    mc "Each member of the team has a different role -from top, jungle, mid, adc (short for attack damage carry), and support, which involves different responsibilities."
    mc "For example, I am a Jungle main, so I'm responsible for helping all of my teammates and securing neutral objectives."
    mc "Top makes individual plays and engages teamfights."
    mc "Mid usually controls decision-making and strategy."
    mc "ADC tries to stay safe and do damage later in the game."
    mc "ADC and Support play together in the bottom lane. The Support takes care of the ADC and helps the team maintain vision of the map."
    mc "Sooo, did everyone understand that?"
